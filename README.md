# ReactJS and Laravel Practice Project

This project is a practice exercise for integrating ReactJS and Laravel together. It includes a separate frontend (ReactJS) and backend (Laravel) folder structure.

## Features

- **Frontend:** Contains a ReactJS application with features like login, register, logout, and CRUD functionalities I've implemented.
- **Backend:** Includes a Laravel application serving as the API backend for the ReactJS frontend.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the frontend and backend separately:
   - For the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` folder and follow the setup instructions in its README file.
   - For the backend, navigate to the `backend` folder and follow the setup instructions in its README file.

## Usage

- Start the backend server first, then start the frontend development server.
- Use the application to practice building full-stack applications with ReactJS and Laravel.
